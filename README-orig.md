## Usage:
-----------
This 'Node.js' application can be used by any one who would like to save time and still have a good README baseline that complies with the most used guidelines on making .md files.
a command line prompt will guide the user thru a series of questions directed to auto populate the README.md file once all the questions of the prompt are done. 

- Here it is an example of the questions prompted when the application is started:
